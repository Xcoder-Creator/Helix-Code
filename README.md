This project is an online interactive programming platform developed in 2022 during my industrial training at NIIT, Port Harcourt, Nigeria. It was built as a personal learning and practice project, not for any client or commercial use.

The purpose of the project was to improve my programming skills, apply concepts learned during training, and serve as a project for industrial training defence. It focuses on hands-on learning, experimentation, and reinforcing core web development concepts.
